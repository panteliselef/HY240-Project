# HY240 Project

### Data Structures Class

In this project we were asked to simulate a couple of battles Alexander the Great fought In.

The project was split in two phases.

In the first we used data structures like Arrays, (Double) Linked Lists, Stacks, and a combination of those.

In the second phase, we were asked to use Binary Search Trees and implement all 3 types of traversals(preorder, postorder, in-order), HashMaps and hash functions, a Heap etc.
